#### Current Projects

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on a language exchange application using React and Redux.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Typescript.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any applications which coordinate city dwellers to create a greener world, applications for a social purpose, learning and coaching.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about React, React Hooks and React Router.
- âš¡ Fun fact: On a Sunday, you'll find me at a contemporary art gallery or if it's autumn, picking red pine mushrooms in a forest.
